            <p class="article-p">The first impression the listener gets from Harry Styles' song, “As It Was,” is a sample from Styles' goddaughter saying “Come on Harry, we want to say goodnight to you.” It puts a warm feeling in your heart as you are invited into Harry's
                House. With upbeat synths and drums, Harry Styles took a different turn on his first single since his album Fine Line (2019). Yet, “As It Was” lyrically provides a certain melancholic nostalgia as Styles longingly sings. Though Styles
                invites us inside his home, what exactly is he thinking about? What used to be there for Styles? What has changed? Let's get into the song's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5v3kku4y6Q" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>

            <h3>2. My Chemical Romance - Helena</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content-article">
            <!-- <article> -->
            <p class="article-p">This song is partially about the death of lead singer Gerard Way's grandmother, Elena Lee Rush. She taught Gerard how to draw, paint and sing, and she gave him his first car - the white van that appears in the original "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)"
                video. The song is dedicated to her, as is the CD. She is mainly who the part "Can you hear me? Are you near me?" is for. But this song also starts the concept of the CD. A man and a woman (Helena) die in a car crash ("When both our cars
                collide"), except the woman doesn't really die, the man only thinks she has. The man is sent to hell. This song is a mourning for Helena's "death" by the man. He is wishing he could see her again and is giving his last goodbyes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5v3kku4y6Q"
                    target="_blank">("So long and goodnight")</a>.</p>

            They admitted that this song was a poem that was turned into a love song. A love story that has just begun, but already holds so many promises, emotional spikes, and hopes. The songwriter, Fathia Izzati admitted that the writing of "Anything You Want"
            refers to the Arctic Monkeys song "Cornerstone", which plays a big role in the love story and the song itself.
